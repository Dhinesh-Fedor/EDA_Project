# Crimes Against Women in India - EDA

## Project Overview

This project, completed as part of the CSE3040 Exploratory Data Analysis coursework, analyzes crimes against women in India to uncover regional patterns and key drivers. Through techniques like regression, clustering, and feature selection, it identifies factors contributing to crime prevalence and highlights disparities across states. The analysis aims to inform targeted interventions and support SDG 5 (Gender Equality) by promoting safety and dignity for women.
